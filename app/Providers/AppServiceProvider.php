     * "enabled" without competing with them.
     *
     * `configureUsing` runs at `make()`, so it is a default rather than an override: any
     * component that names its own `onColor` still wins. Registered here rather than in a
     * panel provider because these closures are recorded against the component class and
     * apply to every panel regardless of where they are declared — putting them in one
     * panel would only disguise that.
